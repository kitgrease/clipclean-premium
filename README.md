# clipclean-pro

Clipboard cleaning for people who care about clean input.

## Why

macOS often adds invisible junk to your clipboard â€” from formatting data to smart quotes and odd spacing.  
This tool strips it away, leaving clean, copy-ready text.

## Features

- Removes invisible formatting, control characters, emojis
- Converts curly quotes to straight quotes
- Optionally collapses spacing and removes empty lines
- Use `--preserve` to keep layout

## Install

Clone this repo and create a shortcut:

```bash
alias clipclean="bash /your/path/to/clipclean-pro.sh"
